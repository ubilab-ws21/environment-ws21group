## Storyline
The escape room is modelled as a power station based in Germany. In the year 2050, the country is hit by a solar storm which caused total power blackout.

In order to escape from this dire situation, they will have to solve a bunch of puzzles to get to the server room to fix the smart grid controller and bring the power back up.
