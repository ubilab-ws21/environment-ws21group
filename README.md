## Storyline
The escape room is modelled as a power station based in Germany. In the year 2050, the country is hit by a solar storm which caused total power blackout. A group of newly recruited interns who were attending orientation are the victims of this unfortunate situation. They find themselves locked inside the room. In order to escape from this dire situation, they will have to solve a bunch of puzzles to get to the server room to fix the smart grid controller and bring the power back up.
